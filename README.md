## Welcome!

My Personal website was my first published web project. It was created during the Fall 2022 semester of my Sophomore year. I was first learning web development and only had experience from my Software Developer Internship at Stevens during Summer 2022. 


## About 

I chose to use Bluehost's Shared Hosting Plan to first host this website on 9/2/2022. I had experience FTPing into some Bluehost servers and I knew it could adequitely host PHP servers (for the email contact form) so it was the easiest choice at the time. It became quite expensive, especially since I don't really use any of the Wordpress features it's meant for-- I literally removed all the WP template code and only host my custom files. 

Overall, I learned a lot from creating this and got my original inspiration from the BootstrapMade designs. Will be coming back to this in the future.

**Update 8/16/2023:** Website is being migrated to a new hosting.

**Update 9/1/2023:** Entirely New Website on the way!
